# Socket chat app

This is a simple chat application made using [this socket.io tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/). 
express.js and jquery are used in the linked tutorial, however this version was built using pure JavaScript.

### To use

Clone the repository and `npm install` any dependencies. 

The server can be run by typing `node index.js`. Then go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
Try opening multiple tabs!
